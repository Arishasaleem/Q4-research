## Generative AI - AN Assignment

### What is Generative AI?

Generative AI is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that can create new content like:

- **Text:** stories, essays, messages  
- **Images:** drawings, designs  
- **Audio:** music, voices  
- **Videos**  
- **Code** for software  

It learns from large amounts of data and then generates original results based on what it has learned.

### How Does Generative AI Work?

1. It is trained on huge datasets (e.g., books, images, or videos)  
2. It learns the patterns and rules from the data  
3. When we give it a “prompt” (like a question or command), it uses what it has learned to create new content

**Example:**  
If you type: “Write a poem about the moon,” it can instantly generate a full poem!
