# 🚀 FastAPI Project – Hello World & Dynamic Routing

This is a beginner-level *FastAPI* project created using *Uvicorn* as the development server.
It demonstrates the implementation of simple API endpoints, including a root route and a dynamic route that accepts
path and optional query parameters.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

This project includes:

- A root route (/) that returns a *"Hello World"* response.
- A dynamic route (/items/{item_id}) that supports both *path parameters* and *query parameters*.
- Auto-generated interactive API documentation using *Swagger UI*.
- Project executed and tested using the uvicorn server in development mode.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- *Python 3.10+*
- *FastAPI*
- *Uvicorn (ASGI server)*

## Generative AI - AN Assignment

### What is Generative AI?

Generative AI is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that can create new content like:

- **Text:** stories, essays, messages  
- **Images:** drawings, designs  
- **Audio:** music, voices  
- **Videos**  
- **Code** for software  

It learns from large amounts of data and then generates original results based on what it has learned.

---

### How Does Generative AI Work?

1. It is trained on huge datasets (e.g., books, images, or videos)  
2. It learns the patterns and rules from the data  
3. When we give it a “prompt” (like a question or command), it uses what it has learned to create new content

**Example:**  
If you type: “Write a poem about the moon,” it can instantly generate a full poem!
